Hi there! In this project I have mainly focused in Javascript fundamentals, DOM Manipulation, Event Listener, Working with media elements, CSS, logics and Refactoring.
I've added sounds for almost every actions. I tried my best to make it better. Here I didn't put much focus on responsiveness. So Play in PC or Laptop for better experience.
I am working on this project to make it responsive to all devices. Thanks.

#About the Game!

I bet that this game is really a fun to play. The game procedure is too simple,
1. Roll the dice.
2. The dice number will be added to the current score as points.
3. Be careful Mr.One(No.1) steal all your coins and give the dice to your opponent player.
4. To keep your coins safe click "HOLD" button. But you must give the dice to your opponent.
5. Reach 100 points to escape from Mr.One.

I tried to add a little story to this game. Hope you like it.

Yeah Thats it. Play and Have Fun..!
